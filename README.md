#ABSTRACT
#Altering the route of immunization of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization from low-dose intradermal vaccination to high-dose intravenous (IV) #injection resulted in a high level of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, providing an opportunity to uncover immune correlates #and mechanisms of protection. Beyond the traditionally accepted role for T cells in controlling Mtb infection, IV BCG vaccination was associated with a #robust expansion of local humoral immune responses that tracked with bacterial control. However, given the near complete protection afforded by high-dose #IV BCG immunization, a precise correlate of immune protection was difficult to define. Here we leveraged plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) #from a cohort of rhesus macaques that received decreasing doses of IV BCG, and aimed to define the correlates of immunity across macaques that experienced #immune protection or breakthrough infection following Mtb challenge. We show an IV BCG dose-dependent induction of Mtb-specific humoral immune responses, #both in the plasma and the airways. Moreover, antibody responses at peak immunogenicity significantly predicted bacterial control following challenge. #Multivariate analyses revealed antibody-mediated complement and NK cell activating humoral networks as key functional signatures associated with #protective immunity. Collectively, this work extends our understanding of humoral biomarkers and potential mechanisms of IV BCG mediated protection #against Mtb.
